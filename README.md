For example: 

- A janitorial services company looking for local restaurants that they can provide their services to
- A print shop looking to reach out to nearby notaries or lawyers offices to provide services
- A food delivery service looking for restaurants that would like their food delivered through their service.
- etc, etc, etc.

## Prerequisites

There are a few things you should know before you start using leadpeak to your leads...

### Credentials & Accounts

To use Leadpeak you'll need to have both a google maps API key and a Hunter.io API key.
Both of these can be acquired for free under relatively gracious free plans. 

- [Hunter.io signup](https://hunter.io/users/sign_up)
- [Google Maps API key instructions](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key)

### Legality & Additional Knowledge

All information that leadpeak collects and aggregates is 100% legally obtained and is collected from the public internet (either the google maps database or public websites where hunter.io has found further contact information).

That said, **It's important that when using leadpeak, and the data it collects, that you're aware of the spam and cold emailing laws in your country/region**. Leadpeak is meant to be used to automate the process of prospecting leads in your local area, not for mass spam campaigns and/or other illegal activity.
